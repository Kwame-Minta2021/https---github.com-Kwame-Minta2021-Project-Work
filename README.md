## ‚ú® Features

**Real-time Air Quality Readings**
- Live display of sensor data for key pollutants: CO (MQ-9), VOCs (MQ-135), CH4/LPG (MQ-5), PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.
- Intuitive color-coding of readings (e.g., green = good, red = hazardous) for quick status assessment.

**Intelligent AI Analyzer (Powered by Reinforcement Learning)**
- Utilizes a sophisticated RL model to process current and historical air quality data.
- Provides clear "Effect on Human Health" insights for detected pollutant levels.
- Recommends "Best Actions to Reduce Presence" of harmful gases and particulates, based on data-driven optimal strategies.

**Interactive Data Visualization**
- Switch seamlessly between Heatmaps, Line Charts, and Bar Graphs to explore data.
- Dynamically generated heatmaps visualize pollutant concentrations over time or across sensor locations.
- Calendar/date-time picker for quick access to historical data; real-time visualization is default.

**PDF Report Generation & Download**
- Instantly generate downloadable PDF reports summarizing current readings, AI analysis, and recommendations.
- Reports include timestamps, raw sensor data, and comprehensive health/action insights.

**Conversational AI Chatbot**
- Integrated AI chatbot provides on-demand, project-scoped assistance.
- Answers questions about air quality conditions, health impacts, recommended actions, sensor readings, and dashboard usage.
- Politely declines or redirects out-of-scope queries.

**User-Configurable Theme**
- Switch between professional Dark and Light modes via a Settings (gear) icon.
- Theme preferences are saved locally and persist across sessions for a consistent experience.

**Professional & Responsive Design**
- Clean, modern, and user-centric UI/UX.
- Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices for seamless interaction.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

This project is implemented with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a modern, production-grade React-based frontend application, seamlessly integrated with Firebase for backend and cloud services.

**Frontend:**
- **Next.js:** Provides server-side rendering, routing, and optimized static generation for a fast, SEO-friendly application.
- **React:** Component-based architecture for maintainable, scalable UI.
- **TypeScript:** Type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Chart.js / D3.js:** Advanced data visualization.
- **CSS / SCSS / Tailwind CSS:** Modular and themeable styling supporting dark/light mode.
- **Integration with Firebase SDK:** Direct interaction with Firestore, Authentication, and Cloud Functions from the Next.js frontend.

**Backend & Data:**
- **Firebase Firestore:** Real-time NoSQL database for sensor readings and AI analysis results.
- **Firebase Cloud Functions:** Serverless backend for:
  - Triggering RL model inference upon new data.
  - Generating and serving PDF reports.
- **Firebase Hosting:** Secure deployment of the web application.
- **(Optional) Firebase Authentication:** User account management.

**AI / Reinforcement Learning:**
- Pre-trained RL model for real-time analysis and recommendations.
- Model deployed and served via Cloud Functions for scalable inference.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

The dashboard is developed as a Next.js application, leveraging its powerful features to deliver a seamless, performant user experience:

- **Data Fetching:** Uses Next.js API routes and React hooks to fetch real-time sensor data from Firebase Firestore, ensuring up-to-date air quality information.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Generation (SSG):** Key pages use SSR or SSG for performance and SEO optimization, while client-side hydration ensures interactivity.
- **Dynamic Imports:** Heavy visualization components and PDF generation libraries are dynamically imported to optimize initial load times.
- **Environment Variables:** Securely store Firebase configuration and API keys using Next.js environment variable management.
- **Theming:** Theme state is managed globally (using Context API or similar), with persistent storage in localStorage for consistent user experience across sessions.
- **AI Integration:** When new sensor data is added, a Firebase Cloud Function is triggered to process the data through the RL model and update Firestore with analysis results. The Next.js frontend fetches and displays these insights in real time.
- **PDF Generation:** On-demand PDF reports are generated either client-side (using libraries like `jsPDF`) or by invoking a Cloud Function for more complex reports.
