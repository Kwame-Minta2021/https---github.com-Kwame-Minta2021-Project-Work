üí® Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard
A professionally designed, real-time air quality monitoring dashboard leveraging cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning (RL) for predictive analysis and actionable insights. This application provides users with comprehensive data visualization, health impact assessments, and a conversational AI chatbot to understand and mitigate air pollution risks.

‚ú® Features
This dashboard offers a rich set of features designed for clarity, usability, and intelligent analysis:

Real-time Air Quality Readings:
Displays live sensor data for critical pollutants: CO (MQ-9), VOCs (MQ-135), CH4/LPG (MQ-5), PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.
Dynamic color-coding of readings indicates concentration levels (e.g., green for good, transitioning to red for hazardous).
Intelligent AI Analyzer (Powered by Reinforcement Learning):
Processes current and historical air quality data using a sophisticated RL model.
Provides clear insights into the "Effect on Human Health" based on pollutant levels.
Suggests "Best Actions to Reduce Presence" of harmful gases and particulate matter, derived from learned optimal strategies.
Interactive Data Visualization:
Allows users to select preferred visualization types: Heatmaps, Line Charts, and Bar Graphs.
Heatmaps are dynamically generated based on sensor readings, representing pollutant concentrations over time or across hypothetical sensor locations.
Historical Data Lookup: A built-in calendar/date-time picker allows users to view and visualize air quality data from specific past periods.
Defaults to real-time visualization upon loading.
PDF Report Generation & Download:
"Generate PDF Report" button instantly creates a downloadable PDF.
PDF reports include a timestamp, raw sensor readings, and the comprehensive AI analysis (health effects and recommended actions).
Interactive AI Chatbot (Project-Scoped):
A conversational AI chatbot provides on-demand information.
Strictly focuses on air quality topics: answers questions about gas conditions, health effects, recommended actions, sensor readings, and general dashboard usage.
Politely declines or redirects out-of-scope inquiries.
User-Configurable Theme (Dark/Light Mode):
A "Settings" button (gear icon) allows users to toggle between a professional Dark Mode and a clean Light Mode.
Theme preference is saved locally and persists across sessions for a consistent user experience.
Professional & Responsive Design:
Clean, modern, and intuitive User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).
Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
üöÄ Technologies Used
This project is built primarily on the Firebase platform, leveraging its powerful backend services and a modern front-end framework.

Frontend:
Firebase Studio (for development and integration)
JavaScript / TypeScript
Modern UI Framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular - specify if you've decided on one)
Chart.js / D3.js (or similar library for visualizations)
CSS / SCSS (for styling and theming)
Backend & Data:
Firebase Firestore: Real-time NoSQL database for storing sensor readings and AI analysis results.
Firebase Cloud Functions: Serverless functions used for:
Triggering Reinforcement Learning model analysis upon new data.
Generating PDF reports.
Firebase Hosting: For deploying and serving the web application securely.
(Optional) Firebase Authentication: If user accounts are implemented.
AI/Reinforcement Learning:
A pre-trained Reinforcement Learning model (details of the model architecture and training environment can be elaborated here if available).
Integrated via Cloud Functions to process data and provide insights.
üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
Firebase CLI (npm install -g firebase-tools)
A Firebase project set up with Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Hosting enabled.
Installation Steps
Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone [Your Repository URL]
cd [Your Project Folder Name]
Install frontend dependencies:
Bash

npm install
# or yarn install
Install Cloud Functions dependencies:
Bash

cd functions
npm install
# or yarn install
cd ..
Configure Firebase:
Log in to Firebase: firebase login
Initialize your project (if not already done): firebase init (Select Firestore, Functions, Hosting, and link to your existing Firebase project).
Ensure your firebase.json is correctly configured for hosting and functions.
Deploy Firebase Functions (if local testing is not fully set up):
Bash

firebase deploy --only functions
Run the application locally:
Bash

npm start
# or yarn start
This will typically open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or similar).
üí° Usage
View Real-time Readings: The dashboard will immediately display the most current air quality data.
Explore Visualizations: Use the dropdown to switch between Line Charts, Bar Graphs, and Heatmaps.
Access Historical Data: Use the calendar picker to select a specific date and time to visualize past readings.
Understand AI Analysis: Refer to the "AI Analyzer" section for health impact assessments and actionable recommendations.
Generate Reports: Click the "Generate PDF Report" button to download a summary of current readings and analysis.
Change Theme: Click the "Settings" (gear) icon in the top right to switch between Dark and Light modes.
Chat with AI: Use the chatbot interface to ask questions about air quality and the data presented.
ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning Model
The heart of the AI Analyzer is a sophisticated Reinforcement Learning model. This model has been trained on extensive datasets comprising various air pollutant concentrations, their known health effects, and the efficacy of different mitigation strategies. Through this training, the RL model has learned to:

Interpret complex sensor data patterns.
Predict potential health risks with high accuracy.
Recommend optimal, context-aware actions to improve air quality, acting as a proactive advisory system for users.
The model is deployed via Firebase Cloud Functions, ensuring scalable and efficient inference without requiring local computations.
